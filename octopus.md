What happens if water damage is not addressed immediately?

Coverage varies by policy, but most homeowners insurance covers sudden and accidental water damage, such as burst pipes or storm damage. It typically does not cover damage caused by neglect or lack of maintenance.

How does a restoration company handle insurance claims?

Restoration companies often work directly with insurance companies to streamline the claims process. They provide documentation and assessments required by insurers to help ensure that your claim is processed smoothly and efficiently.


What steps should I take if I discover water damage in my home?
